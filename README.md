It looks like you're interested in using a dataset related to "tea time" for computer vision projects with Python. While I couldn't find a specific "tea time" dataset, you can create your own dataset or use general image datasets and adapt them for your needs. Here are some steps and resources to help you get started:

1. **Creating Your Own Dataset**:
   - **Collect Images**: You can take photos of various tea time settings, including different types of tea, cups, teapots, and snacks.
   - **Labeling**: Use tools like LabelImg to annotate your images with bounding boxes or segmentation masks.

2. **Using Existing Datasets**:
   - **COCO Dataset**: The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset contains a wide variety of everyday objects, which might include items related to tea time.
   - **ImageNet**: This large dataset contains millions of images categorized into thousands of classes, which can be useful for transfer learning.

3. **Python Libraries for Computer Vision**:
   - **OpenCV**: A powerful library for image processing and computer vision tasks.
   - **TensorFlow/Keras**: Useful for building and training deep learning models for image classification, object detection, and more.
   - **PyTorch**: Another popular deep learning framework that is widely used in computer vision research.

4. **Tutorials and Resources**:
   - **Real Python**: Offers tutorials on computer vision with Python, including image processing and face detection².
   - **LearnOpenCV**: Provides tutorials and code examples for using OpenCV, PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow³.
   - **GitHub Repositories**: Check out repositories like the OpenCV 3 Computer Vision with Python Cookbook for practical examples and code snippets¹.
